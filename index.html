      <p>
        Hi, I'm Sarah! I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, but relocated to Seattle in
        2015 with my husband and two dogs for a change of scenery. I'm an aspiring web developer with 8+ years
        of
        digital marketing experience under my belt, with experience in content writing, email marketing, and social
        media.
        I'm creative and thrive in environments that allow for growth
        and constant learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        When not at work, I enjoy kicking back with a video game (action-adventure RPGs are my thing), hiking, and going
        to shows.

      </p>
